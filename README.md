CS 370 Module Eight Journal Reflection

Project: Pirate Intelligent Agent
Course: CS 370 – Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science

Work Completed

In this project, I built an agent that learns to navigate a pirate world using reinforcement learning. The starter notebook already contained the environment setup and some visualization tools. My main contribution was implementing and tuning the Q-learning algorithm. I adjusted parameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate to improve the agent’s decision-making. I also added printouts and graphs to monitor progress and understand how the agent’s strategy evolved with each training episode.

Connecting Learning to the Field of Computer Science

Reinforcement learning taught me how computer scientists teach machines to make independent choices through algorithms and data. This matters because these same concepts power real-world technologies—from adaptive game AI to self-driving cars. I’ve learned to approach problems by breaking them into logical parts, testing small changes, and iterating based on feedback. Each step, from writing pseudocode to interpreting results, reinforces the problem-solving mindset that computer science depends on.

Ethical Responsibilities

Working with intelligent agents also reminded me that technical accuracy isn’t enough. I have a responsibility to design systems that treat users fairly and behave predictably. Small design decisions, such as how rewards are defined, can shape how an agent “learns” to act. As a developer, I want to write code that’s not just efficient, but also safe, transparent, and ethical for the people and organizations who rely on it.****
